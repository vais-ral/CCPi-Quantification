\begin{hxdescription}
This module calculates tracks of particles in 3D images. It requires labelled images 
to work correctly but it doesn't require that the labels be consistent across all images.

The location of each particle is calculated as the mean position of voxels with a given
label. This will be improved later so the algorithm can locate particles for itself 
(also removing the requirement for labelled images).

To use this module load each image and set the number of frames appropriately. Then connect
the images in the frame order using the connection ports. Set the displacement as an 
estimate of the maximum distance that a particle may move from one frame to the next and 
click the \textit{Apply} button to start the calculation.

If particles are missing from tracks then it is most likely that the displacement value is
too low. Increase it an try the calculation again.
